Sure! Here’s a **complete list of commands** you used (or need to use) to complete the **File Permissions and Ownership** task from start to finish:

---

### 1️⃣ Create the project directory

```bash
mkdir project
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create the file and add content

```bash
echo "This is a sample note." > project/notes.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Check default permissions

```bash
ls -l project/notes.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Remove write permission for group

```bash
chmod g-w project/notes.txt
```

---

### 5️⃣ Add execute permission for owner

```bash
chmod u+x project/notes.txt
```

---

### 6️⃣ Change ownership to root

```bash
sudo chown root project/notes.txt
```

---

### 7️⃣ (Optional) Remove write permission for owner (if needed)

```bash
sudo chmod u-w project/notes.txt
```

---

### 8️⃣ (Optional) Change group to `user` (to fully match expected output)

```bash
sudo chown root:user project/notes.txt
```

---

### 9️⃣ Final verification

```bash
ls -l project/notes.txt
```

Expected output:

```
-r-xr--r-- 1 root user 23 Sep 19 20:25 project/notes.txt
```

If you want, I can **combine all of these into a single bash script** so you can run everything at once without typing each command. Do you want me to do that?
